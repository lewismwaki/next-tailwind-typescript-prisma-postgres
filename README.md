This is a [T3 Stack](https://create.t3.gg/) project bootstrapped with `create-t3-app`.

### Built with Next.js, Tailwind CSS, Typescript, Prisma, PostgresSQL, Railway

## Next Steps

- [ ] validate req.body with third party libraries
- [ ] throw sensible errors for post requests
- [ ] use http-status-codes for status codes
- [ ] create ui for create, update & delete posts, allow media (image, gifs, video)
- [ ] create user with email, phone, password
- [ ] send otp, email
- [ ] implement reset password
- [ ] create profiles for blogger, editor(authorize & make changes to posts), and viewer
- [ ] implement role based access for these different profiles
- [ ] think of different use case other than blogs but close (eg. recipes is a really good choice)
- [ ] think of different related data to link (eg. comments, categories in this context)
- [ ] think of refactoring out of nextjs to provision api for mobile
